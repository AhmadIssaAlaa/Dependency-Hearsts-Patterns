# Dependency-Hearsts-Patterns

DHP is a tool to extract hypernym relation from a corpus based on dependency patterns. More details about DHP exist in the following paper.

## Requirements

The tool was developed with python 3.6, and is not tested for python2.
Nonetheless, cross-platform compatibility may be possible, it was developed and tested on Windows 10.

The tool requires spacy package to be installed: 

    pip install spacy

## Hypernym Relations Extraction

You can extract hypernym relations from a corpus using this tool by two steps:

1- Corpus pre-processing

2- DHP Matching

### Corpus pre-processing
Takes as inputs:

1- a list of corpus files

2- a path for the corpus pre-processing Java Model 

Download the model from the releases in this repository or you can use this link directly: https://github.com/AhmadIssaAlaa/Dependency-Hearsts-Patterns/releases/download/Java_Model/corpus_parsing.jar

The result of corpus pre-processing is saved into new annotated file in the same directory of the corpus.

### DHP Matching:
Takes as input the pre-processed file (the output of the first step) and extract hypernym relations from the corpus.

The result is saved into csv file (extracted_couples.csv) of the form (hyponym, hypernym, frequency). The file is saved in the same directory of the input file.

Frequency: number of extracting one hypernym relation from the corpus.

## Tool Running

only run the main python script (main.py)
